# Formik Accessible Instant Feedback Example

Instant feedback during typing can be extremely helpful in certain situations. For example, checking the validity (or availability) of a username shouldn't require the user to resubmit the form (multiple times). Providing instant feedback while users are typing can allow them to experiment more easily until they find valid input value (like a suitable username). Note: This isn't always optimal, use your judgement.
